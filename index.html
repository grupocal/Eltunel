  <h2>Why to remember?</h2>

          Dear visitor, welcome to my website. I hope that the hours you expend here would help you in the noble quest of mastering the Hebrew language.
  This place is focused on the biblical verbal system, mainly in verbal morphology. The idea of a place like this came to my mind after spending
  some time studying Arabic and Hebrew while majoring on Semitic Studies. Most of my study time was spent repeating lists of conjugations with
  a pencil and some scratch paper, again and again until I mastered it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nowadays, in a society where we can access almost every piece of information with just one click on our smartphones, where the only valuable
  careers are those that produce money or progress, and the richness of our past
  seems to have been forgotten, the act of memorizing might seem old fashioned or boring, maybe even out of place. But nothing farther from the truth.
  Memorizing is not only important, but imperative, if we do not want to be a generation without memories, if we want to teach something to our children,
  to make strong reasonings, or to master some knowledge. It may be political, even revolutionary, because knowledge can not be manipulated, and the only
  difference between something you do not know and something you know is that you remember the later. Even on the Bible we may find this idea in one of it's
  most important verses:
  <br>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="mb-0">
  שְׁמַע, יִשְׂרָאֵל:  יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ, יְהוָה אֶחָד
  <br>
  <br>
  וְאָהַבְתָּ, אֵת יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, בְּכָל-לְבָבְךָ וּבְכָל-נַפְשְׁךָ, וּבְכָל-מְאֹדֶךָ
  <br>
  <br>
  וְהָיוּ הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה, אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם--עַל-לְבָבֶךָ
  <br>
  <br>
  וְשִׁנַּנְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ, וְדִבַּרְתָּ בָּם, בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ בְּבֵיתֶךָ וּבְלֶכְתְּךָ בַדֶּרֶךְ, וּבְשָׁכְבְּךָ וּבְקוּמֶךָ
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="font-italic">
  Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one.
  <br>
  <br>
  And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
  <br>
  <br>
  And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;
  <br>
  <br>
  and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
  </p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">Deuteronomy 6:4</cite></footer>
  </blockquote>
  As we can see, loving our Lord is to remember Him on an active way, to bring Him to our life, so we can offer our life to Him. Remembering is the finest way of knowing, caring and loving. And probably we could
  apply this to almost every aspect of our life.
  <br>
  <br>
  About the way this site works, it is quite simple. There is a module corresponding to each verbal form. On each module you will find a main page with all the tenses conjugated and several pages, each one of them
  with a test that you can run several times until you master it. My intention was to automate the checking of my repeating lists. It was time consuming and not error proof. Both problems are solved with this
  webapp. Memory can never be replaced by technology, but we can use technology as a tool to train our memory. Even thought, sometimes, I still take my pencil and some scratch paper, and enjoy an old school study
  session.
  <br>
  <br>
  In conclusion, dear friend, I hope you find this page useful, and may your efforts be fruitful and your study hours productive, as they should be not like a burden, but as a journey through knowledge and to the
  final Truth.
  And may all of us find it finally, one day. I really hope so.
  <br>
